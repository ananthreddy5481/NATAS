level 0 - 1 :

open the level and go to the page source of the page.
password 0nzCigAq7t2iALyvU9xcHlYN4MlkIwlq

level 1 - 2 : 
same like above go to the page source and get the password. in this level he said that right click is restricted to not to access the page source in the right click.
access the page source by going into the page source of more tools in the application menu.
password TguMNxKo1DSa1tujBLuZJnDUlCcUAPlI
this level says that blocking the UI tools like right click , left click does not help to block access the resources like page source. they can be access by giving the correct request.

level 2 - 3 :
in the page source go to any file source in my case img source file and that was empty and previous directory of the img file is open and readble by everyone.
in the directory there is a file user.txt a text file and as our password is a text try to open that and get the password . 

this tells that the sensitive files should not be kept openly readble to everyone like the /files directory can be accessed by anyone.

level 3 - 4 :
in this the site do not leak info but going into the metadata related to crawls will give you the files in the site and we have only one file in the site in that file there will be password.

crawling - bots will go through the whole site by sending the requests like normal users and helps the search engines to make an index of all the public files at one place.
in general robots.txt is such file which cointains the info about the files present in the site and it will list them all.

password : QryZXc2e0zahULdHrtHxzyYkj59kUxLQ

level 4 - 5 :
in this the request need to be send through other address  that is it specified by the site.
to send like that we have to edit the request sent to the site.
edit the referer header giving the address he gave.
if the server side do not filter the request sent by the client it will give the respose.(BAC).
referer header - the header which will actually say about the address of the previous address of the request coming from.

level 5 - 6 : 

in this level the cookie says that we are not logged in so modifing that cookie value to 1 will give the response that will have password.

password : 0RoJwHdSKWFTYR5WuiAewauSuNaBXned

level 6 - 7 :

we need a key to open the folder that cointains the password .
in the page source we will have info(address) of the file that the key is there .
use it to navigate to the key and give it in the home page to get the password.

password : bmg8SvU1LizuWjx3y7xkNERkHxGre0GS

level 7 - 8 :

in this the parameter is changing for the links given.
so change the parameter and give the parameter value that is given in the page source value.

the vulnerbiltiy is server side is not checking the authorization of the parameter value.
password :  xcoXLmzMkoIP9D7hlgPlh9XD7OgLAe5Q

level 8 - 9 :

in this level the vulnerbility is the low level of encoding and showing that encoded password to us is vulnerble.
decode the given base64 encoded tool.

password : ZE1ck82lmdGIoErlhQgWND6j2Wzz6b6t

level 9 - 10 :

the vulnerbility is the parameter values that we send are directly sent as command that can interupt the flow of work designed by the developer.
in the code developer used "passthru" which will pass the input as a part of the command line.
the parameter input : ;  cat  /etc/natas_webpass/natas10
; - to end the first command (that is grep ) and start the new command (cat command).
password : t7I5VHvpa14sJTUGV0cbEsbYfFP2dmOu

level 10 - 11 :
in this same like above but certain charecters like ; and & are blocked so the developer thinks the user cannot pass the parameter value like above.
use the following command input parameter value : .* /etc/natas_webpass/natas11
the .* will help to /

level 11 - 12 :
in this the XOR encryption is used which is weak.

we need to any two values of a XOR operation to get the third value.

firstly we have the cookie value that is combination of showpassword and bgcolor and there values.

that is first written in jason and then applied XOR encryption and then encoded with base64.

should reverse the process that we need to modify the cookie.
to do that we need to decode and decrypt the existing cookie and change the showpassword to yes for that we need to reverse the XOR function
for that we need the key value.
the key is not shown in the source code so if we have the two values other than key that are the output cookie and the input value(that is json
and base64 encoded) then we can get the key by executing the same code for getting the key as output .
then after knowing the key we should again make the same code for making the new cookie as showpassword=yes using the XOR operation between the 
key and input as json and base64 encoded one as showpassword=yes .

the code for retriving the key is: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>


<?php

$cookie = base64_decode('HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUcqOE1JZjUIBis7ABdmbU1GIjEJAyIxTRg');

function xor_encrypt($in) {
    $key = json_encode(array(
        "showpassword" => "no",
        "bgcolor" => "#ffffff"
    ));
    $text = $in;
    $outText = '';

    // Iterate through each character
    for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($text); $i++) {
        $outText .= $text[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
    }

    return $outText;
}

print xor_encrypt($cookie);
print "\n";

?>

</body>
</html>

level 12 - 13 :

in this the site tells that it will take only jpeg files but there no is proper checking in the code for the type of file uploading.
upload a php file to get the password with the command -- echo passthru("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13");

the uploaded file is stored with the extention of .php in the background but the html in the below generate a link saying that to open the file

but with the jpg extention so there will be an error because there is no file with that complete name(name+jpg extentation).

to change that change the request in the network as the file extention from jpg to php.

password : trbs5pCjCrkuSknBBKHhaBxq6Wm1j3LC

level 13 - 14 :

in this level they used the exif_imagetype() for checking the file type before uploading or sending to the backend.

exif_imagetype() --> this works like it will check the magic numbers of a file type and if they are equal to ff d8 ff e0 (jpeg magic numbers)

we should change the magic numbers of the php file to the jpeg magic nubmers and then upload , do this using the hex editor.

then upload and then when trying to open there will be a problem just like the above unable to open the file.

go to the network tab in devloper tools and change the request(change file from .jpeg to .php).

magic numbers : the numbers in the starting of a file visible when changed to hexadecimal or binary. used to identify the type of the file 
apart from the extention.

level 14 - 15 :

in this the vulnerbility is sql injection the user input is taken directly into the query that makes the user direct access to the query.

so we can directly by pass the login credentials by sql injection.
user name  : " or 1=1 --  [ here the " for closing the username string in the structured query that is wrriten in the code. then
                            1=1 breaks the logic and makes it always true and -- for making the after the query after the input into
                            a comment. due to or 1=1 when the query goes to the database it always give the reply that the username exist]
password : leave empty.
